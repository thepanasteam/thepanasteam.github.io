                **BOOK'S REVIEW**
                <ul>
                    <li>"What happens if we choose entertainment over humanity? In Collins's world, we'll be obsessed with grooming, we'll talk funny, and all our sentences will end with the same rise as questions. When Katniss is sent to stylists to be made more telegenic before she competes, she stands naked in front of them, strangely unembarrassed. “They're so unlike people that I'm no more self-conscious than if a trio of oddly colored birds were pecking around my feet,” she thinks. In order not to hate these creatures who are sending her to her death, she imagines them as pets. It isn't just the contestants who risk the loss of their humanity. It is all who watch."--Publishers Weekly, Megan Whalen Turner, STARRED REVIEW</li>
                        
                    <li>"...brilliantly plotted and perfectly paced...a futuristic novel every bit as good and as allegorically rich as Scott Westerfeld's 'Uglies' books."
                            --The New York Times, John Green</li>
                        
                    <li>“...enthralling, imaginative and creepy...”
                            --Los Angeles Times</li>
