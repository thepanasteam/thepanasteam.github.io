                **BOOK'S REVIEW**
                <ul>
                    <li>"At its best the trilogy channels the political passion of “1984,” the memorable violence of “A Clockwork Orange,” the imaginative 
                    ambience of “The Chronicles of Narnia” and the detailed inventiveness of “Harry Potter.” The specifics of the dystopian universe, 
                    and the fabulous pacing of the complicated plot, give the books their strange, dark charisma."
                    --The New York Times, Katie Roiphe</li>
                        
                    <li>"This dystopic-fantasy series, which began in 2008, has had such tremendous
                    crossover appeal that teens and parents may discover themselves vying for -- and talking about -- the family 
                    copy of "Mockingjay." And there's much to talk about because this powerful novel pierces cheery complacency like a 
                    Katniss-launched arrow. Look skeptically at computer and television images, it suggests, be aware of spin, gaze 
                    upon the young faces of the world's soldiers. Children forced to kill children? It's not just in the pages of a novel."
                    --The Washington Post</li>
                        
                    <li>"Much of the action takes place on a battlefield akin to Iraq — 
                    where innocent civilians are murdered to further a cause and each side resorts to unsavory 
                    tactics that could lead to a terrorist label. More maudlin than the first two books in the series, 
                    "Mockingjay" is also the most violent and bloody and, based on the actions and statements of its characters, 
                    its most overtly antiwar — though not so much that it distracts from a series conclusion that is nearly as shocking, 
                    and certainly every bit as original and thought provoking, as "The Hunger Games." Wow."
                    --Los Angeles Times</li>
