                                In 1991, Suzanne Collins began her professional career writing for children’s television. 
                                She worked on the staffs of several Nickelodeon shows, including the Emmy-nominated hit Clarissa Explains it All and The Mystery Files of Shelby Woo. For preschool viewers, 
                                she penned multiple stories for the Emmy-nominated Little Bear and Oswald. She also co-wrote the Rankin/​Bass Christmas special, Santa, Baby! with her friend, Peter Bakalian, 
                                which was nominated for a WGA Award in Animation. Most recently she was the Head Writer for 
                                Scholastic Entertainment’s Clifford’s Puppy Days,and a freelancer on Wow! Wow! Wubbzy! While working on a Kids WB show called 
                                Generation O! she met children’s author and illustrator James Proimos, who talked her into giving children’s books a try. <br> <br>
                                Thinking one day about Alice in Wonderland, she was struck by how pastoral the setting must seem to kids who, 
                                like her own, lived in urban surroundings. In New York City, you’re much more likely to fall down a 
                                manhole than a rabbit hole and, if you do, you’re not going to find a tea party. What you might find...? 
                                Well, that’s the story of Gregor the Overlander, the first book in her five-part fantasy/​war series, 
                                The Underland Chronicles,which became a New York Times bestseller. It has been sold into 21 foreign territories. <br> <br>
                                
                                Her next series, The Hunger Games Trilogy, is an international bestseller. 
                                The Hunger Games has spent over six years to date on The New York Times bestseller list since publication in 
                                September 2008, and has also appeared consistently on USA Today and Publishers Weekly bestseller lists. 
                                It has been sold into 56 territories in 51 languages. In 2010 Collins was named to the TIME 100 list as well as the 
                                Entertainment Weekly Entertainers of the Year list. <br> <br>
